\section{Overview}


The CMS Technical Document Repository (TDR) system provides a straightforward
environment for the preparation of reports and notes by
large numbers of authors working concurrently.
It comprises the following components:
%
\subsection{TDR Document Repository}

All files that are required for the assembly of completed documents
are stored in a central CMS svn repository (called \texttt{tdr2}).
The repository contains the common style files and build tools as well
as all the user-generated text (\LaTeX) files and figures.
This system facilitates the sharing of documents, concurrent working, and
means that users do not need to keep any files in their private area.


\subsection{Document style files}
%
Common \LaTeX\ style files have been pre-defined for CMS Technical Design Reports
(also used for EoIs, LoIs, and other large documents), CMS Notes, Internal Notes, and
Analysis Notes.
Template examples are provided enabling the user to get started
with minimal overhead.


\subsection{Document build system}
%
The philosophy of the TDR system is to keep the \LaTeX\ document style
commands distinct from the user-content.
A \texttt{tdr} perl script is then provided that assembles on the fly
a complete \LaTeX\ document using pre-existing standard fragments
and the users' \LaTeX\ files.
It then proceeds to build the document by processing the \LaTeX,
resolving cross-references and citations (using BibTeX), and
creating a PDF (portable document format) file.
The user selects the style of the document (CMS Note, Analysis Note, etc.)
by specifying an option to the \texttt{tdr} command.
It is therefore totally trivial to switch from one style to another.

\subsection{External software}
%
The system is designed to be independent of the CMS environment.
All that is required is \texttt{svn}, \texttt{perl}, and a standard
installation of \LaTeX.
These are already part of the standard CERN Linux environment. It is also relatively easy to install on non-CERN Linux systems, Mac OSX, and Windows.

%.......................................................................
\subsection{Getting started}

To \textbf{create a new document} in the repository, for example a CMS Note, see section~\ref{newdoc}.

To \textbf{edit the document} once the template has been created, see section~\ref{edit}.

To \textbf{build a formatted manuscript} (PDF) for your document see section~\ref{tdr}.

For \textbf{advice on using \LaTeX}, for example to include figures, see section~\ref{latex}.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\clearpage
\section{Creating a new document\label{newdoc}}


All files reside in a standard CMS svn repository (called \texttt{tdr2}).
As long as you are a member of the CMS e-group, you can use a web browser to see the repository: \href{https://svnweb.cern.ch/cern/wsvn/tdr2/?}.
On any machine with the CMS environment (\eg, \texttt{lxplus.cern.ch}) you can check out either the \emph{entire} repository or selected portions
with the \texttt{svn} repository address \texttt{svn+ssh://svn.cern.ch/reps/tdr2}


%............................................................................
\subsection{Creating a new note or analysis summary}

To start
you will need to request a note directory in the \texttt{svn} repository from the TDR manager (currently \href{mailto:George.Alverson@cern.ch}{George Alverson}
or \href{Lucas.Taylor@cern.ch}{Lucas Taylor}). It is best to supply a list of the lxplus usernames of the co-authors who are to have write access to the repository at the time of the request.

To generate output, check out your note
directory from \texttt{svn} following the example below. The \texttt{tag} below is the identifier for your paper, typically of the form XXX-YY-NNN.
Following the sequence below will populate your local copy of the repository  with only your note and not include the other notes. If you have a note, use ``notes".
For a paper, use ``papers." [Note: when running without Kerberos authentication, use svn+ssh://username@svn.cern.ch\ldots Additional information on accessing \texttt{svn} is available at the \href{CERN Central SVN Sevice web site.}{http://svn.web.cern.ch/svn/howto.php\#accessing-clients} ]

\begin{verbatim}
> svn co -N svn+ssh://svn.cern.ch/reps/tdr2 myDir
> cd myDir
> svn update utils
> svn update -N [papers|notes]
> svn update [papers|notes]/XXX-YY-NNN
> # use the following line for tcsh. use -sh for bash.
> eval `[papers|notes]/tdr runtime -csh`
> cd [papers|notes]/XXX-YY-NNN/trunk
# (edit the template, then to build the document)
> tdr  --style=paper b XXX-YY-NNN
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Working at FNAL: The LPC}
The LPC environment has a script, \texttt{/uscmst1/prod/sw/cms/[cshrc|shrc]}, which sets up a number of aliased commands for working on CERN resources while at FNAL. The svn command is missing, so you'll need to fix it yourself:
\texttt{alias svn 'env KRB5CCNAME=/tmp/krb\_cern\_`id -u` svn'} for \texttt{tcsh},\\
\texttt{alias svn='KRB5CCNAME=/tmp/krb\_cern\_`id -u` svn'} for \texttt{bash}.

The \texttt{kserver\_init} command will initialize the KRB5CCNAME file and allow for seamless communication without further intervention.

%............................................................................
\subsubsection{Naming convention for Analysis Notes and Physics Analysis Summaries}

A new directory is created in the \texttt{tdr2/notes} directory, named according
to the convention chosen by the analysis group, \eg \texttt{TOP-07-005}.
Once created, this directory will contain a template note named according to
the analysis name, \eg \texttt{TOP-07-005.tex}. The \texttt{tdr} script will automatically
generate the \texttt{cmsNoteHeader} from the directory name.

\subsubsection{Special Note on Physics Analysis Summaries}
PAS documents are loaded into the \href{http://cdsweb.cern.ch/collection/CMS\%20PHYSICS\%20ANALYSIS\%20SUMMARIES}{CDS} archives after approval. At this point, the title \emph{as stored in the \texttt{hypersetup} \texttt{pdftitle}
field} is passed to CDS as the document title. This allows for a fully formatted \LaTeX\ title on the document and a natural language title for easy searching. The abstract, on the other hand, is taken from the \texttt{abstract} \LaTeX\ version. Both are run through a simple-minded pre-processor for display. The preprocessor will not see any \TeX\ macros, however, so those should should not be used.

%............................................................................
\subsubsection{Naming convention for CMS Notes, and Internal Notes}

A new directory is created in the \texttt{tdr2/notes} directory, named according to
the convention: \texttt{contactAuthor\_serialNo}.
\texttt{contactAuthor} is the CMS username (see the CERN ``phonebook'' command)
which is used for subsequent access control.
\texttt{serialNo} is a simple serial number (001, 002,\ldots) for the note
generated at the time of the request; it is \emph{not} anything to do with the
final CMS note number which will be assigned independently during the review process.
For example the first note requested by Paris Sphicas resides in
the directory \texttt{tdr2/notes/sphicas\_001}.
Once created, this directory will contain a template note
called \texttt{contactAuthor\_noteNo.tex} and a sub-directory
called \texttt{fig} in which figures (PDF files) may be stored.

%............................................................................
\subsection{Creating a new Technical Design Report (or LoI, EoI, etc.)}

For major reports, a new directory is created in the reports directory, \eg, \texttt{tdr2/reports/p1utp}
for the Phase 1 Upgrade Technical Proposal.
This directory will contains the following sub-directories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{tex}   - latex files and subdirectories (\eg, for different chapters);
  \item \texttt{fig}   - figure files and subdirectories;
  \item \texttt{bib}   - bibtex file(s) for references.
\end{itemize}
%
Note that for TDRs this sub-structure is assumed to exist by the \texttt{tdr}
script (described below); if you change it things may fail.



%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\clearpage
\section{Modifying a document and working with svn\label{edit}}


\texttt{svn} is similar in many ways to \texttt{cvs}. Once a repository has been checked out, the workflow is
almost identical except for tagging. In \texttt{svn}, tagging is done by creating a new directory branch using
the \texttt{svn copy} command. Please see the \texttt{svn} \href{http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn-book.pdf}{manual} for details, particularly
the chapter on \href{http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn-book.pdf#svn.branchmerge}{branching and tagging} and \href{http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn-book.pdf#svn.forcvs}{svn for cvs users}. Please do not change the depth of the directory structure to the top-level \TeX\ file for your document. The template is created in the \texttt{trunk} subdirectory, and this is what is used by default. You should also note that \texttt{svn}, as opposed to \texttt{cvs}, does allow for easily moving and copying directory trees.

\emph{Please make sure to configure your svn client:} edit \texttt{\~/.subversion/config} so that it appropriately tags pdf files.
\begin{verbatim}
[auto-props]
*.pdf = svn:mime-type=application/pdf
*.png = svn:mime-type=image/png
*.jpg = svn:mime-type=image/jpeg
*.tex = svn:eol-style=native
*.eps = svn:mime-type=application/postscript
\end{verbatim}

There are other useful settings as well. For example, to stop \texttt{svn} from asking to commit backup files and object files, you can set the \texttt{global-ignores} flag:
\begin{verbatim}
[miscellany]
global-ignores = *.o *.bak
\end{verbatim}


%....................................
\subsection{Checking out desired files}

Checkout the directory which contains the source files of
the document you wish to work on.
In addition to your specific note directory, you will see the
following general files/directories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{tdr}     - a script for building documents (described below);
  \item \texttt{utils/general} - a R/O directory containing the style files.
  \item \texttt{tmp}     - a temporary directory used for output PDF, etc.
\end{itemize}
%


%....................................
\subsection{Editing the document}
%
Simply edit any of the \LaTeX\ files with your favourite text editor.
For example, for a new note, start with the
file \texttt{contactAuthor\_noteNo.tex}.



%---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Committing your changes into the svn repository}

\textbf{\emph{Before committing any changes always check your changes are valid \LaTeX,
otherwise you will break the document for all other authors.}}

Firstly, check the local file, \eg, \texttt{myfile.tex} by doing  \texttt{tdr build myfile}.

If \texttt{myfile.tex} is included in a bigger document, \eg, \texttt{ctdr.tex,}
then you must also check that this builds: \texttt{tdr build ctdr}.
In both cases you should check that a valid PDF file is produced that
looks as expected.
\LaTeX is rather verbose with its warnings, however it is imperative to
look and  verify that there are no \textbf{error} messages, and no  \textbf{unresolved} references.


Changes to files are committed to (i.e. stored into)  the repository using
%
\vspace*{-2.5ex}\begin{verbatim}
  > svn commit -m''Comment explaining changes made''
\end{verbatim}
The -m option should always be used to add a short informative
message.

Finally:  do not forget to \texttt{svn add} any new files to the
repository.
It is not sufficient to just do a \texttt{svn commit}. New files must be
first added and then committed.


\subsubsection{Checking everything is OK with svn}

If you want to see the status of your local files compared to the
repository type:

\texttt{svn  status}

Run this command using the \texttt{-u} switch (\texttt{--show-updates}) to see any changes relative to the repository.

The first character of each line tells you the status of the file:
\begin{description}
\item [A] means the file has been scheduled for addition to the repository.
\item [M] means you have modified your local copy.
\item [D] means it is scheduled for deletion.
\item [C] means there is a conflict between your version and changes downloaded from the server.
Try to avoid doing this (messy) step by committing frequently.


\item [?] means you have a file locally that \texttt{svn} knows nothing about.
        Maybe it's meant to be local (\eg, is temporary). If you want it to be in the repository then you must use
	\texttt{svn add} and the \texttt{svn commit}.
\item [*] (if run with -u or --show-updates) shows a file which has changed on the server. This is in a second column.
\end{description}


%---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Creating a standalone paper, \eg, for submission to a journal}

If you wish to export your paper (for publication, local work or for security),
you can produce a tarball with all the necessary files with
\vspace*{-2.5ex}\begin{verbatim}
> tdr --style=note --export b mynote.
\end{verbatim}
This will function on  Unix or Windows systems which have
recent copies of \LaTeX\ (including \AmS-\LaTeX) and \texttt{perl} installed.

Please see also section~\ref{sec:journal-formatting} on formatting for journals.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\clearpage
\section{Building a formatted manuscript\label{tdr}}

The \LaTeX\ file(s) must be processed to produce a
fully typeset and formatted manuscript in PDF (Portable Document Format).
A \texttt{tdr} perl script is provided for building the whole or
parts of your document, as described below.
There is no need use any of the following commands yourself:
\texttt{latex},
\texttt{pdflatex},
\texttt{pdftex},
\texttt{bibtex},
\texttt{dvips}, or
\texttt{dvi2pdf}.
They are all replaced by the \texttt{tdr} script.


%....................................
\subsection{Initializing your environment}
%
Set up the runtime environment by typing:
%
\vspace*{-2.5ex}\begin{verbatim}
  > eval `./tdr runtime -sh`     // if you use Bourne-shell or Korn shell
  > eval `./tdr runtime -csh`    // if you use c-shell or tc-shell
\end{verbatim}
%
This must be done from the top-level directory of the checked out
area, i.e. the location of the \texttt{tdr} script.
Note also that the syntax uses single \emph{back} quotation marks.

The \texttt{tdr} command has a simple scram-like syntax with
\texttt{runtime, build, clean,} and \texttt{veryclean} commands,
support for one-letter abbreviations and so on.
For details on \texttt{tdr} options type:
%
\vspace*{-2.5ex}\begin{verbatim}
  > tdr help
\end{verbatim}
%....................................
\subsection{Building a PDF file from a \texorpdfstring{\LaTeX}{LaTeX} file}
%
To create a PDF file from a \LaTeX\ file \texttt{myPaper.tex}, simply type:
%
\vspace*{-2.5ex}\begin{verbatim}
  > tdr build myPaper      (or simply:  tdr b myPaper)
\end{verbatim}
%
Assuming the \LaTeX\ files have no errors in them, the last line of the
screen output will tell you the location of the output PDF file.
It is stored in the top-level \texttt{tmp} directory together
with various log files.

If the build fails, check the printout on the screen for \LaTeX\ errors
and resolve them; typically these are trivial syntax errors.
Then run the build again.
%....................................
\subsection{Choosing the document style}
%
You can choose to format the paper according to various pre-defined
styles using the \texttt{style} option, for example:
%
\vspace*{-2.5ex}\begin{verbatim}
  > tdr  --style=note  build  myPaper
\end{verbatim}
%
will format the paper as a CMS Note.
Valid styles are
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{tdr}  for large reports (the default),
\item \texttt{paper} for a paper to be submitted to a journal,
\item \texttt{note} for CMS Notes,
\item \texttt{an}   for Analysis Notes,
\item \texttt{pas}  for Physics Analysis Summaries,
\item \texttt{in}   for Internal Notes.
\end{itemize}

Note that PAS documents can be in either draft mode (the default), or non-draft,
as set by the \texttt{--nodraft} switch.

%....................................
\subsection{What your \texorpdfstring{\LaTeX}{LaTeX} files should (not) contain}

%The short answer is they should contain plain \LaTeX\.
%\end{document}

The \texttt{tdr} script makes a copy of your simple \LaTeX\ file
and automatically inserts all the required \LaTeX\ boilerplate
commands to produce a fully consistent \LaTeX\ document in the
\texttt{tmp} directory, in accordance with the CMS document
style requested in the command line options (see above).
It then processes the document using Pdf\LaTeX\ with several passes
to resolve cross references; citations are handled using BibTeX.
%\end{document}

Therefore, it should be stressed that the file \texttt{myPaper.tex}
should \emph{not} contain any document definition commands (\eg,
\texttt{\textbackslash{}documentclass},
$\backslash${\texttt{begin$\lbrace$document}}$\rbrace$
and so on).

%....................................
\subsection{Making partial builds}
%
To speed things up, especially for large documents, the \texttt{tdr}
command can build single chapters, sections, or indeed any
arbitrary \texttt{\LaTeX} files.
For example, if your main file is called \texttt{myPaper.tex}
and looked like:
%
\vspace*{-2.5ex}\begin{verbatim}
\input{titlepage.tex}
\input{introduction.tex}
\input{data-analysis.tex}
\input{results.tex}
\end{verbatim}
%
then you could use the following commands
%
\vspace*{-2.5ex}\begin{verbatim}
  > tdr build myPaper   // build everything as a single PDF paper
  > tdr b results       // build just the results section as PDF
\end{verbatim}
%
In general you should be in the directory in which the
\LaTeX\ file resides. The script will search downwards in the directory tree for it, but if more than one version exists, it will not be able to determine which one to build. This situation (multiple copies of the top file) is guaranteed to occur once a tag or branch has been made, so it is important to note this.

%....................................
\subsection{Setting the default file to build}
%
To save specifying your preferred build target (\eg, \texttt{myPaper.tex}) each
time, just set the Unix environmental variable \texttt{TDR\_TARGET}
to \texttt{myPaper}.
Then you can just type
%
\vspace*{-2.5ex}\begin{verbatim}
  > tdr b
\end{verbatim}
%
If \texttt{TDR\_TARGET} has not been set, then \texttt{tdr} builds this document.

A similar variable, \texttt{TDR\_STYLE}, controls the default style.
%....................................
\subsection{Cleaning up}

To clean up temporary files (i.e the locally-created \texttt{tmp} directory):
\vspace*{-2.5ex}\begin{verbatim}
  > tdr clean
\end{verbatim}
%
To clean up temporary files and emacs and nedit backup files:
\vspace*{-2.5ex}\begin{verbatim}
  > tdr veryclean
\end{verbatim}



%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Formatting for Journals\label{sec:journal-formatting}}
You can produce versions of your document formatted following the standards of several of the journals to which CMS submits physics results. Journal-specific options are passed as strings. To use
our defaults, use a single dash as the option:


\begin{verbatim}
tdr --style paper --aps - b XXX-08-000
\end{verbatim}

Please note that the \texttt{tdr} script can automatically take the pdfkeywords and format them for the equivalent journal field.

\begin{description}
\item[APS] use the normal command for a paper, but add the appropriate APS options with, \eg, \texttt{--aps="reprint,prl,linenumbers"}. See the revtex documentation for details on APS options. Information on the revtex style for use with APS journals can be found at \url{http://authors.aps.org/revtex4/} and download sites are listed at \url{https://authors.aps.org/revtex4/revtex4_faq.html#download}. APS does not accept sub-directories nor included \TeX files, so the necessary files will either be included or moved to the top level, as appropriate, for submission.
\item[PLB] use \texttt{--plb="3p,twocolumn,times"} or any other set of Elsevier options. See \url{http://www.elsevier.com/framework_authors/misc/elsdoc.pdf} for details on the Elsevier elsarticle style. As for the APS, PLB only accepts a flat file structure. The PLB default bib style will convert to lowercase all except the first word in the titles of references, so escape proper names, acronyms, \etc, with curly braces, \eg, "\verb|Search for {ADD} extra dimensional gravity|\ldots"
\item[EPJC] Please provide (using the if-then construction described below) a \verb|\titlerunning| in the text before the \verb|\maketitle|. This is used to create a running head so it cannot be longer than roughly half a page width. When EPJC sets articles, they tend to use the \verb|\sidecaption| macro and have caption plus two small plots run across the full page. This option is not accessible in the CMS style although one can pass it to the EPJC style via an if-then.
\item[JHEP] JHEP accepts papers in the CMS style.

\end{description}

For instances where the CMS style and the journal style are incompatible, one may use an \textit{if-then} construction to bracket alternatives:

\begin{verbatim}
\ifthenelse{\boolean{cms@external}}{%
%% journal specific text
}
{%
%CMS specific text
}
\end{verbatim}

Note, however, that many formatting changes that are required for the two-column format of many journals can be accommodated in the standard CMS style. Using the \texttt{*} format for figures that should extend across two columns does not effect placement for us. If you resize figures, use units of \verb|\columnwidth|, which is the same as the \verb|\textwidth| in single column format.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Supplemental Material for Journals\label{sec:journal-supplements}}

Supplemental material should be placed in an independent \LaTeX\ file, \eg, supplemental\_material.tex. This file will be included via conditional code in the main document (say GEN-12-001.tex, representing a GENeric document) when it is formatted for CMS and for the arXiv, and excluded in the journal version. A third file, GEN-12-001\_supp.tex should have the supplemental material included wrapped in a standard document template, which will provide an independent file for uploading to the journal.

So for GEN-12-001.tex,
\begin{verbatim}
...
\bibliography{auto_generated}
\ifthenelse{\boolean{cms@external}}{}{
\clearpage
\appendix
\section{Supplemental information title\label{app:suppMat}}
\input{supplemental_material}
}
\end{verbatim}
while for GEN-12-001\_supp.tex,
\begin{verbatim}
\title{GEN-12-001 normal title \texorpdfstring{\\[1cm]
---Supplemental Material---}{: Supplemental Material}}
\author[cern]{The CMS Collaboration}
\date{\today}
\abstract{}
\hypersetup{%
...}
\maketitle
\null\cleardoublepage
\input{supplemental_material}
\end{verbatim}

The title of GEN-12-001 should be modified from that of the normal document: \verb|\title{|Normal Title\verb|\\[1cm]|---Supplemental Material---\verb|}|.
To generate all three types of files, arXiv (same as CMS format), PRL, and PRL supplement, the commands would be
\begin{verbatim}
tdr --style paper --aps - b GEN-12-001
tdr --style paper  b GEN-12-001
tdr --style paper --supplement --no-draft --preflight b GEN-12-001_supp
\end{verbatim}

You should specifically note how the supplemental material is referenced within the main file: the APS specifies, for instance, that the format for the reference in the text is ``See Supplemental Material at [URL will be inserted by publisher] for [give brief description of material]," so we use (for example) ``The results are available in tabulated form in \verb|\suppMaterial|", where we have defined \verb|\suppMaterial| in the GEN-12-001\_supp.tex file as
\begin{verbatim}
\ifthenelse{\boolean{cms@external}}
{\providecommand{\suppMaterial}{the supplemental material
  [URL will be inserted by publisher]}}
{\providecommand{\suppMaterial}{Appendix~\ref{app:suppMat}}}
\end{verbatim}

In the absence of a table of contents we can freely substitute anything we like for ``Appendix"  in the string above. If there is a table of contents, the \verb|\appendixname| should be conditionally redefined so that in CMS format it would be \verb|\renewcommand{\appendixname}{|Supplemental Material\verb|}|.

\section{Advice on using \texorpdfstring{\LaTeX}{LaTeX}\label{latex}}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\LaTeX}{LaTeX} macros for commonly used constructs}

Provisions are made to implement macros across TDR volumes, within a
volume, or even locally in a particular section. However, in order to
establish a standard look and feel for the text symbols in the TDR
volumes
(such  as for $E_\text{T}$ and $p_\text{T}$),
%(such  as for $\ET$ and $\PT$),
we encourage use of the generally
defined macros and strongly discourage local use unless you are
certain a similar symbol would not be used by another editor.

At the top-most level, definitions defined in
{\texttt{tdr2/utils/trunk/general/ptdr-definitions.tex}} are
available to all TDR volumes. An extensive set of macros have been
defined there and should be used whenever possible. They include, for
example, $\backslash$\texttt{ET}, $\backslash$\texttt{fbinv},
$\backslash$\texttt{sTop}, etc.
At the top-level of each TDR
(\eg, in \texttt{tdr2/reports/ptdr1/trunk/tex/definitions.tex}, there is another
file \texttt{definitions.tex} for volume-specific definitions. Macros
should be suggested and implemented for
frequently used constructs or common symbols or names, \eg,
{$\backslash$\texttt{etc}}
could be defined to produce ``\emph{etc.}'' and so on.
The macros in the \texttt{definitions.tex} files are usable
in tex files at all levels of the particular TDR.

Use {$\backslash$\texttt{newcommand}} to define a new command that does not exist,
{$\backslash$\texttt{renewcommand}} to re-define a new command that already exists,
or {$\backslash$\texttt{providecommand}} to define a new command but accept the old
definition without complaint if it has already been defined.

To override a general definition in \texttt{TDR/general/ptdr-definitions.tex}
simply (re-)define it in the local \texttt{definitions.tex}. But please
consult with the appropriate TDR editor.

We stress that it is important to use the macros in case a global style change must be made to suit the standards of a particular journal.

\subsection{Fonts}
Do not override the default fonts. They are currently set to be
Palatino and Helvetica. The math fonts have also been changed to
Palatino so that they do not clash with the body text,
particularly in regards to numbers and units. This means the
authors should use \verb|\text| commands to put text in subscripts
and superscripts, and most importantly \emph{do not use}
\verb|\rm| in formulas, otherwise you will end up with formulae looking like the second one below.

\begin{gather}
\phi = \text{a Greek letter}\\
{\rm \phi} = \text{a mistake}
\end{gather}

Also note that the math fonts include a full set of Greek symbols in Math Italic Bold (produced with \verb|\mathbold|),
but only uppercase in Math Bold (\verb|\mathbf|). Use \verb|\boldmath| or \verb|\boldsymbol| to get bold symbols: \verb|{\boldmath{$\alpha \otimes \beta$}}| : {\boldmath{$\alpha \otimes \beta$}}. (Note the enclosing braces.) Most journal styles do not have the \verb|\boldmath| command.



It is also advisable to use the \verb|\textrm{Some text}| form rather than
\verb|{\rm Some text}|. The same is true for the other short-form holdovers from plain \TeX,
\verb|\tt| and \verb|\it|, particularly if you would like to submit your paper to a journal
with minimal re-editing.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Editorial macros}


In addition to the extensive measurement and physics symbols,
some editorial macros are defined in
\texttt{tdr2/utils/trunk/general/definitions.tex} as well.
For example, the following tex fragment:
\begin{verbatim}
   \editor{Jane Doe} \\
   \contributor{Tom Cobbley} \\
   \fixme{check this number!} \\
\end{verbatim}
%
produces the following. \\
\bigbreak
\editor{Jane Doe}\mbox{~}\\
\contributor{Tom Cobbley}\mbox{~} \\
\fixme{check this number!}\mbox{~}\\

Notes use \texttt{author}, \texttt{address}, and \texttt{abstract} commands.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Inclusion of Figures}

Figures should reside in the \texttt{fig} directory of the corresponding TDR (volume).
A figure may be included as follows:
%
%\vspace*{-2.5ex}
\begin{verbatim}
   Figure~\ref{fig:test} shows a figure prepared with the TDR
   template and illustrates how to include a picture in a document
   and refer to it using a symbolic label.
   \begin{figure}[!Hhtb]
      \centering
      \includegraphics{width=0.55\textwidth}{c1_BlackAndWhite}
      \caption[Caption for TOC]{Test of graphics inclusion.\label{fig:test}}
   \end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
%
Please note that documents intended for journal submission should usually include the \texttt{fig} in the path name supplied to \texttt{includegraphics} and not rely on the automatic search.

The result of the above is roughly as follows:
%
% \clearpage

\begin{quote}
Figure~\ref{fig:test} shows a figure prepared with the TDR
    template and illustrates how to include
a picture in a document and refer to it using a symbolic label.
\end{quote}

    \begin{figure}[!Hhtb]
      \centering
\vbox{
        \combinedfigure{width=0.55\textwidth}{c1}{c1}
      \caption[Caption for TOC]{Test of graphics inclusion.\label{fig:test}}
}
    \end{figure}

Note that the file extension (type) for the filename (\eg, \texttt{c1{\underline{\mbox{~}}}BlackAndWhite.pdf} above)
is not explicitly specified.
Also note that authors should use an alternate short caption within the
first set of brackets when the complete caption is unduly long for
including in the list of figures in the Table of Contents.

Also note that the current recommended size for figures is
\texttt{0.55$\backslash$textwidth} for square plots, and \texttt{0.7$\backslash$textwidth} for ones
with a standard (i.e., produced using the root template described in
Section~\ref{sec:root}) rectangular aspect ratio.

Finally, note that correct results for the labeling occur only if you
place the \texttt{label} command within the caption environment.


\subsubsection{Colour Figures}

Figures will generally be printed in black and white for paper versions of the
final document.
We have found that the automatic conversion of colour figures to black and white
often results in a lack of legibility, so we recommend that all authors provide a
black and white version for each figure which they have checked for legibility
on an actual paper copy.

Colour versions of figures can by provided for PDF output using the \verb+combinedfigure+ macro
in place of the  \texttt{$\backslash$includegraphics} command.
This takes two arguments corresponding  respectively to the black and white
and the coloured versions of the same picture, for example:
%
\vspace*{-2.5ex}\begin{verbatim}
   Figure~\ref{fig:test} shows a figure prepared with the TDR
   template and illustrates how to include a picture in a document
   and refer to it using a symbolic label.
   \begin{figure}[!Hhtb]
      \centering
      \combinedfigure{width=0.4\textwidth}{c1_BlackAndWhite}{c1_Colour}
      \caption[Caption for TOC]{Test of graphics inclusion.\label{fig:test}}
   \end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
%
Both figures should have the same size or the pagination may be affected.


\subsubsection{How to include multiple figures}

If you need to include multiple figures into the figure environment
(i.e., you need only one common caption), the recommended procedure is to
use multiple instances of the \texttt{$\backslash$includegraphics} command, combined
with the \texttt{tabular} environment if needed. Please do not use the
\texttt{subfig} environment just to get ``(a)'' and ``(b)'' labels, it
is a waste of white space and does not look as nice as putting the
labels directly on the plot. Moreover, do not use the \texttt{picture}
environment to draw the labels, because the coordinate system is
absolute on the page and not relative to where the figure will be
placed (i.e., this only works for the very final version). In short, to
label multiple figures, it is best to embed the label into the plot.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{How to handle figures in PDF, jpeg, and PS formats}

Files with extensions of \texttt{.pdf} (recommended) and \texttt{.jpg}
are automatically picked up.
Direct import of \texttt{.eps} files is not
supported by the \texttt{pdftex} driver which is used to convert
\LaTeX\ to PDF.
You are advised to convert your \texttt{.eps} file to a \texttt{.pdf} file
using Adobe Acrobat (best results), the \texttt{epstopdf}
command or \texttt{ps2pdf -dEPSCrop}, and commit that to \texttt{svn}.\footnote{An alternative approach
would be to use \LaTeX\ plus \texttt{pstopdf}.
However, this often fails to produce correct \texttt{.ps} and hence
\texttt{.pdf} output files; nor does it support the inclusion of
\texttt{.pdf} or \texttt{.jpg} pictures which are generally much more compact
than the corresponding \texttt{.eps} files.
}
Try to avoid converting figures through an intermediate program, such
as Powerpoint, and instead convert the natively produced
Postscript. If you do convert an EPS file, you are encouraged to also
commit the original EPS version as well in case of conversion
problems found later. The editors may re-convert if necessary.


Also, keep in mind that some later versions of PDF (\eg, 1.5) will
conflict with the Pdf\LaTeX\ machinery on many systems, including
\texttt{lxplus} so please save figures (\eg, from Distiller) with version
1.3 or 1.4, if possible.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Where to store figures}

In general the figures should reside in the \texttt{fig} directory or one
of its subdirectories.
A \texttt{fig} directory exists for each major document, \eg,
\texttt{tdr2/reports/ptdr1/trunk/fig/} or \linebreak[3]\texttt{tdr2/reports/ctdr/trunk/fig/}. Small papers with only a few figures do not
require the use of a subdirectory.

Do \emph{not} refer to any figures which reside outside the
TDR repository; instead, \texttt{svn add} the file in the \texttt{fig}
directory and check it in.

By default figures are looked for in the \texttt{fig} directory.

If a figure file resides in a subdirectory, \eg, \texttt{fig/muon},
of the \texttt{fig} directory, then simply prepend the directory
name when referring to the figure in the
\texttt{$\backslash${}includegraphics} command (i.e. \texttt{muon/c1} in the
above example).



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Standard macro for figures produced with ROOT \label{sec:root}}

To maintain a standard look and feel for the figures in the Physics
TDRs, a Root macro was
contributed by Thomas Speer. Figure~\ref{fig:test} shows an example
plot made using it. In the TDR repository check out:
\texttt{tdr2/utils/trunk/general/tdrstyle.C}. To use it:
%
\begin{verbatim}
.L tdrstyle.C
setTDRStyle()
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Convention for figure and table captions}

Figure captions should be located below each figure, as shown in the
example above. Table captions, however, should reside \emph{above}
the table and use \texttt{topcaption}.  For example:
%
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \topcaption{Table captions are above the table whereas figure
    captions are below.}
    \label{tab:mytab}
    \begin{tabular}{lcc} \hline
       Parameter & Value 1 & Value 2 \\ \hline
       $s$ & 10.0 & 20.0 \\
       $t$ & 20.0 & 30.0 \\
       $u$ & 30.0 & 40.0 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
\end{verbatim}
%
which produces the following:
%
\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \topcaption{Table captions are above the table whereas figure
    captions are below.}
    \label{tab:mytab}
    \begin{tabular}{lcc} \hline
       Parameter & Value 1 & Value 2 \\ \hline
       $s$ & 10.0 & 20.0 \\
       $t$ & 20.0 & 30.0 \\
       $u$ & 30.0 & 40.0 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
%



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Chapters, Sections and Other Sectioning Commands}

For all notes use the following
section heading commands:
\texttt{$\backslash${}section},
\texttt{$\backslash${}subsection},
\texttt{$\backslash${}subsubsection}, and
\texttt{$\backslash${}paragraph}.
For Technical Design Reports the top-level sectioning command
is \texttt{$\backslash${}chapter} followed by all the above
sectioning commands.

The PDF bookmarks produced from Pdf\LaTeX\ will choke on \TeX symbols,
\eg, ``2.6 This is a
``026E30Fsection'' for ``2.6 This is a $\backslash$section'' since \TeX\ uses 026E30F to represent the backslash. Use the
\verb+\texorpdfstring+ macro:
\begin{verbatim}
\section{Finding the split \texorpdfstring{$A_2$}{A2}}
\end{verbatim}

And this is what it should look like:

\subsection{This is a \texorpdfstring{$\backslash$\texttt{subsection}}{subsection}}
This is some text.

\subsubsection{This is a \texorpdfstring{$\backslash$\texttt{subsubsection}}{subsubsection}}
This is some text.


\paragraph{This is a \texorpdfstring{$\backslash$\texttt{paragraph}}{paragraph}}
This is some text.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Cross-references and bibliographic citations}

\subsubsection{Referring to Sections, Figures, Tables, etc.}
\texorpdfstring{\LaTeX}{LaTeX} provides powerful, robust, and scalable facilities for
cross-referencing based on symbolic labels.
Please use them!

For example, to create symbolic links to a chapter
and a section:
%
\vspace*{-2.5ex}\begin{verbatim}
   \chapter{Mass Storage Systems\label{ch:mss}}
   \section{Requirements\label{sec:mss-requirements}}
\end{verbatim}
%
Note that the \texttt{label} command is contained \emph{within} the
curly braces of the appropriate sectioning command so that
the value can be resolved correctly.
For figures and tables, the \texttt{label} command should be
similarly enclosed within the associated \texttt{caption} command.

To then refer to the chapter and section:
\vspace*{-2.5ex}\begin{verbatim}
   The CMS hierarchical mass storage systems, described in
   Chapter~\ref{ch:mss} will be of a size unprecedented in
   HEP, as described in Section~\ref{sec:mss-requirements}.
\end{verbatim}

This will result in output something like:
\begin{quote}
   The CMS hierarchical mass storage systems, described in
   Chapter~9 will be of a size unprecedented in
   HEP, as described in Section~9.1.
\end{quote}
%
Note that the numbers (9 and 9.1) are automatically generated
according to the placement of the \texttt{label} commands
in the overall context of the document.
The number of digits (levels) is determined automatically from
the level of the sectioning command used (chapter, section,
subsection, etc.).

Always -- \emph{repeat always} -- use symbolic labels
(\eg, \texttt{sec:mss-requirements})
for references and not hardwired numbers
(\eg, \texttt{9.1})
as the latter will invariably become wrong very quickly.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Bibliographic References}

All bibliographic entries are defined in a BibTeX file
(i.e., files with \texttt{.bib} extension in the \texttt{bib} directory
of the TDR (volume) of interest.
This enables a standard format to be ensured and helps avoid
duplicated entries.
Before defining a new bibliographic item, please check in the
\texttt{.bib} files whether it has already been defined, and if so
then use it as it is. When creating new BibTeX entries, the format of
the bibliographic entries is mostly self-evident and one can
cut-and-paste from an existing entry (well, check that it produces
reasonable output) and then change the text.

Keep in mind that for listing authors, the BibTeX implementation uses
``Last Name, First Name'' (and it automatically abbreviates the first
name). Concatenate authors using ``and'', and instead of writing
``\emph{et
al.}'' use ``and others.'' BibTeX will handle the substitution,
and our style file will trim the author list automatically after three authors. For
complicated names, you can place them in braces ${}$, but do this
sparingly.


We strongly recommend the use of the inSPIRE\footnote
{\url{http://inspirehep.net}} BibTeX labels when such an
article can be found there, because a unique label is created and
\LaTeX\ can spot multiply-defined references. It also saves you the time
of creating the entry yourself. Such an entry looks like:

\begin{verbatim}
@Article{Agostinelli:2002hh,
     author    = "Agostinelli, S. and others",
     collaboration = "GEANT4",
     title     = "{GEANT4}---a simulation toolkit",
     journal   = nim,
     volume    = "A506",
     year      = "2003",
     pages     = "250-303",
     SLACcitation  = "%%CITATION = NUIMA,A506,250;%%",
     DOI       = "10.1016/S0168-9002(03)01368-8"
}
\end{verbatim}

However, in the above instance and for many other \emph{commonly} cited
references, we will use a more conventional name (\eg,
GEANT4 instead of Agostinelli:2002hh). So please check the other bibliography files to see if yours
is already defined. The information should also be verified. In the above citation, the title was not quite right on inSPIRE.

In addition, we recommend setting the ``DOI'' field that was added to
the Article BibTeX format in the TDR framework (and is illustrated
above). This field represents
the Digital Object
Identifier for your reference.\footnote{\url{http://www.doi.org/}}
When you prepend this number with \url{http://dx.doi.org/}, your
browser is automatically directed to the electronic version of the
article (provided your institution has paid for this access). Currently
you need to manually determine and enter this field after examining the
publication.

To refer to an item in the bibliography using its symbolic label
in your text, use one of the following forms:
\vspace*{-2.5ex}\begin{verbatim}
   Either: the CMS detector is described elsewhere~\cite{CMSTP};
   or: the CMS detector is described in reference~\citenum{CMSTP}.
\end{verbatim}

This will result in output something like:
\begin{quote}
   Either: the CMS detector is described elsewhere~[34];
   or: the CMS detector is described in reference~34.
\end{quote}
%
Note the omission of the square brackets in the second form,
where the reference is explicitly (rather than parenthetically)
referred to.

The list of references will be placed at the end of the TDR. It is
suggested that each group maintain a separate \texttt{.bib} file in the
\texttt{bib} directory for the chapter specific references. Common
references for the entire TDR will be kept in a common file (\eg, ptdr1.bib). Common software references will be kept in
software.bib.

\subsubsection{Web References}
Please use the \verb+\href+ and \verb+\url+ commands to embed links into your document.

Example:\\
\verb+\url{http://cms.cern.ch/iCMS/}+ gives \url{http://cms.cern.ch/iCMS/},\\
\verb+\href{http://cms.cern.ch/iCMS/}{The CMS web site}+ gives \href{http://cms.cern.ch/iCMS/}{The CMS web site}.
